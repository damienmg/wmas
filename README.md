Usage
-----

For now, the program is short on documentation. Sorry guys...

If you use Maven for compilation using "mvn package" a
jar with dependencies will be generated under the target
directory. This jar is directly runnable like any Java
program.

When running a window will open letting you edit the
world, the entities and so on... No time to enter more
into details so don't hesitate to contact me if you are
wishing to use it (and to help me with the documentation :p).
